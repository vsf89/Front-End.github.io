                    January marks the beginning of the year. January's the coldest month in some parts of the world.
                    New year. New day. New month. New everything.
                    People make new year resolutions, promises to be kept for all year.
                    Some people work on themselves. Many people try to get rid of bad habits.
                    But, research shows these resolutions just vanish within a week for 99% of the people.
