                    <b>March</b> brings Spring to the world. However, in cold countries near the Arctic, Spring is not
                    visible.
                    Snow is still on the ground and sometimes light snowfall happens. Some birds start appearing.
                    Some birds are coming back, while other are migratory
                    People start sowing seeds indoors, to be planted outside, once snow melts and temperatures are
                    consistently in positive degrees.
