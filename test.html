                    March bringss Spring to the world. However, in cold countries near the Arctic, Spring is not visible.
                    Snow is still on the ground and sometimes light snowfall happens. Some birds start appearing. 
                    Some birds are coming back, while other are migratory. 
                    People start sowing seeds indoors, to be planted outside, once snow melts and temperatures are consistently in positive degrees.
